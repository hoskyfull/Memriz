## User Story
Memriz is a game where you can practice your memory elasticity and work your memory muscles! The goal is to rememner the highlighted tiles that will reveal themselves for a moment. The player will see a 6x6 grid, a score and a start/clear button. Once the player clicks 'Start', 3 tiles will light up in a color for 1.50 seconds. The player has to remember which tiles light up and will then click on those tiles. If the player has selected the 3 tiles 3 times succesfully, the player wins. Otherwise if the player selects the wrong wrong one, then the player loses and the points reset. 

### Future work

* Include a timer

* Highlight the tiles that the player clicks and do not match the randomly selected ones

* Add extra levels that increase difficulty (e.g:less highlighting time, more tiles added)

* Add a box that will include the number of tiles to be clicked for the current level

* Increase the number of highlited number of tiles

### Bugs

There are several bugs to the game that can be worked in the future. 

* Highlighted tiles sometimes do not match. In other words, game will highlight only 2 instead of 3, even though it does select the boxes (we can see it in the console.log). Seems that when it selects the same tile number/id in the random selection more than once, it does not highlight. Maybe create a for loop that will remove already highlited tiles with a condition of not repeating that same tile.

* Clear button does not clear sometimes, having to refresh the page.
