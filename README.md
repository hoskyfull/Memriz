## User Story
Memriz is a game where you can practice your memory elasticity and work your memory muscles. The player will see a 3x3 grid, a timer, score and a start/reset button. Once the player clicks 'starts', 2 squares will light up in a color for 0.25 milliseconds and the player has to remember which squares light up. The player will then click on those squares. The player has 5 seconds to select the squares, if not, they lose.
